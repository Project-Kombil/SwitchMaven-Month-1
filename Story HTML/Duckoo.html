            <p>
                Born into a humble family, Duckoo was the quiet kid in the pond. Because of his vulnerability, he was the target of bullies in his kindergarten school. He had to fend for himself and that led him into boxing. His father bought him his very first boxing gloves on his third birthday.
                <br>
                He had won every prize in school throughout his young life and did the same in college where he won honors after honors for outstanding work.

                He did not stop his boxing career while coming up in the ranks of the best duck-tors of the world. Winning 10 world championships in a row earned Duckoo a spot in the <b>Guinness World Book of Records</b>.
                Funny enough, most of his patients were his opponents in the ring.
